## Flask Application Design for Financial Planning Web App

### HTML Files

- `index.html`: This file will serve as the landing page of the application. It will display a form that allows users to input their financial information like their income, expenses, savings goals, etc.

- `results.html`: This file will display the financial plan generated based on the user's input. It will include visualizations and recommendations to help users improve their financial situation.

### Routes

- `/`: This route will handle displaying the `index.html` file and allowing users to submit their financial information.

- `/results`: This route will handle processing the user's input and generating a financial plan. It will then display the `results.html` file with the generated plan.

### Additional Features

- It is crucial to remember that this is just a basic structure. You may need to add additional HTML files and routes to implement specific features and functionalities for your financial planning app.
- You should also consider incorporating Bootstrap as the frontend framework for a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
- Finally, the app should be designed to be mobile-responsive to ensure a seamless user experience on all devices.
